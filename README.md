# messy_CRQAexpm
This repository contains a rather messy version of the codes used to pre-process and apply crqa to the linguistic data of my Experiment 4 / Chapter 5 ("Social impression and lexical convergence") in my PhD Thesis.

A cleaner annotated version will follow (hopefully) soon.

The order of use is:

1. DataPrep1.R
2. DataPrep_2TS_Silence.R
3. CrqaAnalysis_2TS_series_2diagline.R
